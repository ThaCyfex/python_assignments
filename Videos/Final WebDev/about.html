      <h2>The Legend of the Dark Knight</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there, I’m excited to tell you all about Batman. Bruce Wayne, the man behind the cowl, witnessed tragedy at a young age, setting him on a path to become Gotham’s guardian. I share this lore to show you how loss, determination, and intellect combined to forge the ultimate vigilante.
      </p>
      <p>
        I explain how Batman relies on his detective skills, physical training, and technological innovations instead of superpowers. His mission is driven by a deep personal loss and an unwavering commitment to justice in a city overwhelmed by darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read, envision the shadowy alleys, the piercing night, and Gotham’s unyielding spirit that shape every aspect of Batman's world.
